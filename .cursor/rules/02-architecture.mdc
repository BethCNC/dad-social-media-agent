# Architecture & Folder Structure

The project uses a **monorepo** layout:

```text
/ai-social-copilot
  /frontend        # React + Vite app (TypeScript)
  /backend         # FastAPI app (Python 3.10+)
    app/
      services/    # Contains gemini_client.py, creatomate_client.py, etc.
  /deploy
    Dockerfile

## Responsibilities

### Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)

- Collect inputs: content brief, tone, platforms, length, optional user clips.
- Display:
  - Generated script and caption.
  - AI-generated visual assets and selections.
  - Render status and preview URL.
  - Scheduling options and confirmation.
- Communicate only with the **FastAPI backend** via Axios.

### Backend (FastAPI)

- Expose REST API for the frontend.
- Orchestrate calls to:
  - Google Gemini 3.0 Pro (`gemini-3-pro-preview`) for text generation (content plans, scripts, captions, schedules).
  - Nano Banana Pro (`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`) for image generation (visual assets based on shot descriptions).
  - Creatomate (video rendering using generated images or uploaded videos).
  - Ayrshare (social scheduling).
- Contain business logic in `services/`, including `gemini_client.py` for all Gemini API interactions.
- Handle validation, errors, and configuration via Pydantic models and a `Settings` class.

### Infrastructure

- **Docker multi-stage build**:
  - Stage 1: Node image to build Vite frontend.
  - Stage 2: Python image to run FastAPI and serve static frontend.
- Single container deployed to **Coolify**, exposing port `8000`.
