# AI Social Media Co-Pilot – Project Overview

This project is an **AI Social Media Co-Pilot** that helps an older, non-technical client plan and publish TikTok and Instagram content.

The app should:
- Turn simple ideas or prompts into **scripts + captions**.
- Suggest and assemble **stock video clips**.
- Trigger basic **short-form video renders**.
- Prepare and optionally **schedule posts** via APIs.

## Core Goals

- Keep the UX **simple and forgiving** for an older user.
- Centralize all logic in a **React + FastAPI** app.
- Use external APIs for:
  - AI text generation (OpenAI `gpt-4o`)
  - Stock video (Pexels)
  - Video rendering (Creatomate)
  - Social publishing (Ayrshare)
- Package everything in a **single Docker image** and deploy via **Coolify**.
