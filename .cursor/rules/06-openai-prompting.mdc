# OpenAI Prompting & JSON Schemas

The OpenAI integration is the “brain” of the app. It should output **structured JSON** that maps directly into Pydantic models.

## Target Model

Use the `gpt-4o` model.

## Desired Output Shape

Map to `GeneratedPlan`:

```jsonc
{
  "script": "string - spoken script for the video",
  "caption": "string - social media caption including relevant hashtags",
  "shot_plan": [
    {
      "description": "string - what the shot should show",
      "duration_seconds": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

## Prompting Guidelines

- System message should explain:
  - You are helping create **short-form vertical videos** for TikTok and Instagram.
  - The client is an older, non-technical person who needs simple, clear language.
  - Responses must be JSON only, matching the specified schema.
- User message should include:
  - The content brief (idea/topic).
  - Tone (friendly, educational, inspiring, etc.).
  - Target platforms.
  - Approximate length if provided.

Example high-level instructions to the model (not exact prompt text):

- “Write a short, conversational script that can be spoken in 20–40 seconds.”
- “Make the caption friendly and clear. Include 3–5 relevant hashtags.”
- “Create 3–6 shot descriptions that a stock video search engine could understand.”

## Error Handling

- Use `response_format` or explicit instructions to force JSON.
- If parsing fails:
  - Log the raw response (without secrets).
  - Return a 500 error with a clear message to the frontend.
