# Cursor Project Rules – AI Social Media Co-Pilot

You are the AI pair-programmer for this project.

## Core Rules

- Use the existing tech stack only:
  - Frontend: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Lucide + Axios.
  - Backend: FastAPI + Python 3.10+ + Pydantic + httpx/requests.
  - Infra: Docker multi-stage build, deployed via Coolify.
- Do not introduce other frameworks (e.g., Next.js, Django) unless explicitly requested.
- Always keep the user experience simple and clear for an older, non-technical client.

## Implementation Priorities

1. Scaffold monorepo structure (`frontend`, `backend`, `deploy`).
2. Implement FastAPI app with `/health` endpoint and CORS.
3. Implement React shell with a `NewPostWizard` flow.
4. Wire up OpenAI (`/api/content/plan`) to produce `GeneratedPlan` (script + caption + shot_plan).
5. Add Pexels integration for `/api/assets/search`.
6. Add Creatomate integration for `/api/video/render` and render status.
7. Add Ayrshare integration for `/api/social/schedule`.
8. Add error handling and loading states on the frontend.
9. Finalize Dockerfile and ensure the full flow works on Coolify.

## Code Organization

- Follow the folder structures defined in the markdown docs in this repo.
- Keep route files small; move logic into services and client modules.
- Keep React components focused and composable.
- Use TypeScript types that align closely with Pydantic schemas on the backend.

## Behavior When Unsure

- Prefer asking for clarification only if absolutely necessary.
- Otherwise, choose a practical, standard solution and document assumptions in comments.
