## 5. Content Patterns (Templates)

The AI should structure content around a few repeatable patterns:

### 5.1 Educational Tip Post

1. **Hook:**  
   - A short line about a common pain: energy crashes, cravings, feeling stuck with habits.
2. **Explanation (1–3 sentences):**  
   - Simple explanation of what’s happening (e.g., blood sugar ups and downs, busy schedules).
3. **Supportive habit + product connection:**  
   - Mention a small habit change (timing of meals, fasting window, water, walking, etc.).
   - Show where Unicity products can support that habit (e.g., Balance with meals, Unimate in place of sugary drinks).
4. **CTA:**  
   - Soft: “If you’re curious, here’s the info link: {REFERRAL_LINK}.”
   - Avoid hard selling or pressure.

### 5.2 “How I Use It” / Routine Post

1. Short context about morning or evening routine.
2. Where Feel Great / Unimate / Balance fits into that routine.
3. How the routine helps them feel (energy, focus, fewer crashes) without giving medical promises.
4. CTA with link.

### 5.3 Story-Based Post (if compliant)

1. Short personal story or “before/after” style feeling (tired, struggling with cravings, etc.).
2. Steps they took (lifestyle + product).
3. Emphasize ongoing habits, not quick fixes.
4. Include disclaimer.

## 6. Compliance & Disclaimers

Unicity’s own materials emphasize that distributors must follow **strict compliance rules**, including limitations on medical and income claims. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

For this client:

- **Never**:
  - Claim the products treat, cure, or prevent diseases.
  - Promise specific weight loss amounts or timelines.
  - Promise specific income or “get rich” results.
- **Always** include an appropriate health disclaimer when describing benefits, for example (paraphrased, adjust as needed):

> “These products are part of a healthy lifestyle. This is not medical advice. Talk to your healthcare provider before making changes to your routine.”

For any business/income content (if you ever add that later):

- Keep it very conservative and in line with Unicity’s Income Disclosure and Social Marketing Guidelines.
- For the MVP, it’s safer to **avoid income/business opportunity posts altogether**.
