---

## ✅ Brand Guidelines Compliance

### 1. **Unicity Compliance**

The app enforces Unicity's official compliance requirements:

#### **Mandatory Hashtags (ALWAYS included in every post)**
- `#metabolichealth`
- `#healthyliving`
- `#unicity`

These are automatically added to **every** caption generated by the system.

#### **Health Disclaimers (ALWAYS included at end of caption)**
```
These products are intended to support a healthy lifestyle. This is not medical advice. 
Talk to your healthcare provider before making changes to your routine. Results vary.
```

#### **Forbidden Language (NEVER used)**
- ❌ Disease claims: "cures diabetes", "treats condition", "prevents disease"
- ❌ Guaranteed results: "you will lose 10 pounds", "guaranteed to fix"
- ❌ Income promises: "make $X per month", "join my team"
- ❌ MLM recruitment: "DM me to learn how to make money", "build your downline"

#### **Approved Language (ALWAYS used)**
- ✅ "supports metabolic health"
- ✅ "helps with energy and focus"
- ✅ "can make it easier to manage appetite"
- ✅ "as part of a healthy lifestyle"

---

### 2. **TikTok Platform Compliance (2025-2026)**

The app follows TikTok's current platform policies and algorithm best practices:

#### **TikTok Bans MLM Promotion**
- No recruitment language ("join my team")
- No income claims or business opportunity mentions
- Focus on education, lifestyle, and personal wellness journey

#### **TikTok Restricts Medical/Health Claims**
- No disease names in claims context
- No cure or treatment promises
- Educational focus on wellness, habits, routines

#### **Soft CTAs Only (Link in Bio)**
All captions use approved soft CTAs:
- ✅ "If you're curious what I use, the link's in my bio."
- ✅ "Want to learn more? Check the link in my bio."
- ✅ "I put more details about this in my bio - check it out if you're interested."

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Direct URLs in captions (bad for TikTok algorithm)
- ❌ "Click here: [URL]"
- ❌ Hard-selling language

---

### 3. **TikTok SEO Optimization (2025-2026)**

The app optimizes content for TikTok's search engine:

#### **Keyword Placement** (in every post)
1. **On-screen text** (first 3 seconds) - includes main keyword
2. **Spoken audio** - keyword spoken near start of script
3. **Caption** - natural keyword integration
4. **Hashtags** - mix of specific + broad

#### **Example Keyword Strategy**
- Topic: "stable energy throughout the day"
- On-screen text: "3 tips to reduce afternoon energy crashes"
- Spoken: "If you struggle with afternoon energy crashes, watch this."
- Caption: "Feeling that 3pm crash? Here are 3 habits that helped me stabilize my energy (no crazy hacks)."
- Hashtags: `#metabolichealth #healthyliving #unicity #bloodsugartips #energyhacks`

---

### 4. **Content Structure (TikTok Algorithm 2025)**

Every script follows a proven 4-part structure:

#### **1. HOOK (0-3 seconds) - CRITICAL**
- Must grab attention immediately or viewers scroll
- Uses pain points: "If you crash every day at 3pm, watch this."
- Examples: "Here are 3 things I changed about my mornings after 40."

#### **2. CONTEXT/EMPATHY (3-8 seconds)**
- Build connection: "I used to feel wiped by mid-afternoon..."
- Creates "me too" moment

#### **3. VALUE STEPS (8-30 seconds)**
- Tip 1, 2, 3 with clear structure
- Actionable and simple
- Shows B-roll of daily life

#### **4. SOFT CTA (last 3-5 seconds)**
- "If this was helpful, save this for later."
- "If you're curious what I use in my routine, the link's in my bio."

**Target duration:** 15-45 seconds (optimal for completion rate)

---

### 5. **Content Pillars Distribution**

The app balances content types to avoid feeling like an infomercial:

- **60-70% Pure Value** (education, routines, stories without product mention)
- **20-30% Value + Product** (product appears naturally in routine)
- **<10% Direct CTA** (still compliant, not MLM-y)

#### **Specific Pillar Breakdown**
- **Education (~40-50%)**: "Why" content - explanations about energy, cravings, habits
- **Routines & Habits (~20-30%)**: "How" content - morning/evening routines, habit stacks
- **Story-based (~10-15%)**: "Me too" content - relatable struggles and feelings
- **Product Integration (~20-30%)**: Product shows up inside routine naturally

---

### 6. **Visual Guidelines (Headless Account)**

All shot descriptions **EXCLUDE people, faces, and human subjects**:

#### **✅ APPROVED Shot Descriptions**
- "coffee cup steam rising morning light wooden table peaceful"
- "healthy breakfast bowl overhead view colorful fresh ingredients"
- "green smoothie in glass jar marble background healthy drink"
- "fresh vegetables arranged on cutting board kitchen counter"
- "wellness product bottle close-up white background studio lighting"

#### **❌ FORBIDDEN Shot Descriptions**
- "person doing yoga" (includes person)
- "woman holding smoothie" (includes person + face)
- "man preparing breakfast" (includes person)

**Why:** This keeps content focused on wellness themes, avoids identity issues, and aligns with Unicity's product-focused approach.

---

### 7. **Unicity Product Positioning**

When products are mentioned, they follow these approved focus points:

#### **Feel Great System**
- "supports metabolic health"
- "makes intermittent-fasting-style routines more doable"
- "helps manage appetite and energy as part of a healthy lifestyle"

#### **Unimate**
- "supports energy and mental clarity"
- "supports mood and focus"
- "helps manage appetite in daily routines"

#### **Balance**
- "supports digestion and satiety"
- "slows carbohydrate absorption"
- "provides fiber and nutrients as part of balanced meals"

---

### 8. **Series Thinking (Consistency Strategy)**

The app creates **2-3 recurring series** per schedule to build anticipation and help the algorithm understand your niche:

#### **Example Series**
- "Energy Tip Tuesday" (educational)
- "Evening Reset Routines" (routine)
- "My 40+ Wellness Check-in" (story)

Series create:
- ✅ Consistency and anticipation
- ✅ Algorithm niche understanding
- ✅ Viewer loyalty
