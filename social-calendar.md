### **30-Day "Feel Great" Social Media Content Calendar**

This calendar is designed to build trust, educate your audience, and softly sell the **Feel Great System** (Unimate + Balance) without being overly "salesy."

**Strategy:** The **4-1-1 Rule** (4 Value/Entertainment posts, 1 Soft Sell, 1 Hard Sell).
**Posting Times:** Aim for 8:00 AM (Morning Routine) or 7:00 PM (Relax/Scroll time).
**Stories:** Post 3-5 stories daily showing you *actually using* the products (mixing, drinking, shaking).
