## 1. How the TikTok algorithm works in 2025–2026 (what it rewards)

TikTok is a **personalized recommendation engine** that test-drives every video in stages.  

**Key signals:**

- **Watch time / completion rate** – most important. Videos that are watched to the end (or replayed) are far more likely to be pushed.  
- **Early engagement** – likes, comments, shares, saves in the first “test batch” viewers.
- **User interactions over time** – what they normally watch, like, comment on, follow, etc.  
- **Video info** – caption text, on-screen text, sounds, hashtags, topic signals.  

**Practical implications:**

- Short, **high-retention** videos beat long, boring ones.
- You must **hook in the first 1–3 seconds** or they’ll scroll.  
- Topic clarity (caption + on-screen text + spoken keyword) helps TikTok know *who* to show it to.

## 2. TikTok SEO in 2025–2026 (search is huge now)

TikTok has effectively become a **search engine**, and “TikTok SEO” now matters as much as the FYP.  

### 2.1 How people search

- Users search “**how to…**”, “best…”, “does X help with…”, “daily routine for…”.  
- TikTok ranks based on:
  - Relevance (keywords in caption, on-screen text, audio)
  - Engagement + watch time
  - Account and niche consistency

### 2.2 Where to put your keywords

Use your main keyword in:

- **On-screen text in first 3 seconds**  
  E.g. `Text overlay: "3 tips to reduce afternoon energy crashes"`.
- **Spoken audio**  
  Say the main phrase once near the start.
- **Caption**  
  Short, natural language + key phrase:  
  `Feeling that 3pm crash? Here are 3 habits that helped me stabilize my energy (no crazy hacks).`
- **Hashtags**  
  Mix of:
  - 1–2 *specific* (#metabolichealth, #bloodsugartips)
  - 1–2 *broad* (#wellness, #healthyliving)
- **Thumbnail text** (if you use custom covers).

**For your dad’s niche**, keyword themes could be:

- “how to feel more stable energy”
- “evening routine for better sleep”
- “how to build healthier snack habits”
- “what I eat for more stable energy”

Stick to **behavior / lifestyle**, not disease names and medical claims.

## 3. Content strategy: how to grow *and* sell without triggering bans

Given the MLM ban and health-claim restrictions, you want **value-first content pillars**:

### 3.1 Suggested content pillars

1. **Education (“why”)**  
   - Short explanations about energy, cravings, routines, habits.
   - Simple metaphors / visuals, no clinical promises.

2. **Routines & habits (“how”)**  
   - Morning / evening routines.
   - “What I do before bed to set up tomorrow’s energy”.
   - Small habit stacks your dad actually uses.

3. **Story-based (“me too” connection)**  
   - Brief “before/after” *feelings*, not radical transformations.
   - “I used to crash hard at 3pm; here are three changes that helped me.”

4. **Social proof / community (careful)**  
   - General encouragement: “you’re not alone, many people struggle with…”.  
   - Avoid screenshotting DMs or testimonials with medical or income claims.

5. **Soft product integration**  
   - Product shows up *inside* the routine:
     - A drink during morning walk.
     - A supplement *as part of* a meal.
   - CTA: “If you’re curious what I’m using, link is in my bio.”

### 3.2 Content mix

A realistic mix for 2025–2026:

- ~60–70% **pure value** (education, routines, stories)  
- ~20–30% **value + soft product mention**  
- <10% **direct CTA** (still compliant and not MLM-y)

This keeps the account from feeling like an infomercial and aligns with how the algorithm rewards **useful, watchable content**.

## 4. Creative best practices for short-form video

Short-form is still “king” across platforms in 2025 because it’s easier to consume and produce while matching attention spans.  

### 4.1 Length

- Sweet spot: **15–45 seconds** for most videos.
- Experiment with occasional **45–60 seconds** when you’re telling a deeper story.
- Completion rate beats raw length.

### 4.2 Structure for each video

Use a simple repeatable structure:

1. **Hook (0–3s)**  
   - “If you crash every day at 3pm, watch this.”  
   - “Here are 3 things I changed about my mornings after 40.”

2. **Context / empathy (3–8s)**  
   - “I used to feel wiped by mid-afternoon…”

3. **Value steps (8–30s)**  
   - Tip 1, 2, 3.
   - Show B-roll of daily life.

4. **Soft CTA (last 3–5s)**  
   - “If this was helpful, save this for later.”  
   - “If you’re curious what I use in my routine, the link’s in my bio.”

### 4.3 Visual & audio basics

- **Vertical 9:16** always.
- **Good lighting** (window light is fine).
- **Clean audio** or use voiceover + trending sound underlay at low volume.
- Add **captions** (burned-in or auto-captions). Many users watch with sound low/off.
- Use text overlays to:
  - Reinforce hook
  - Highlight step numbers
  - Add key phrases (for SEO)

### 4.4 Trend usage

- Trend sounds and formats **still help**, but:
  - They’re not enough to build a lasting audience.  
  - Prioritize **original content + strong hooks** over chasing every trend.

## 5. Posting cadence & engagement strategy

### 5.1 Frequency

- For growth: **3–7 posts per week** is realistic.
- Think in **series**, not one-offs:
  - “Energy Tip Tuesday”
  - “Evening Reset Routines”
  - “My 40+ Wellness Check-in”

Series create anticipation and help the algorithm understand your niche.

### 5.2 Timing & early engagement

More important than exact posting time is **what happens in the first hour**:

- Reply to comments quickly.
- Pin a helpful comment (FAQ, disclaimer, link reminder).
- Encourage saves (“save this to try later”) and shares (“send to someone who needs this”).

### 5.3 Analytics feedback loop

Use TikTok analytics to track:

- **Average watch time** vs. video length.
- **Retention curve** (where do people drop off?).
- **What topics or hooks outperform** others.

Then refine:

- Double down on topics with higher completion rates.
- Kill formats that consistently underperform.

## 6. Selling responsibly: turning views into action without triggering enforcement

Given TikTok’s rules and FTC expectations, the safest funnel looks like:

1. **TikTok = front-end education + light invitation**
   - No income promises.
   - No big medical promises.
   - No recruitment language.

2. **Profile link = deeper explanation / sales page**
   - Move serious detail (pricing, legal disclaimers, more claims, etc.) off-platform to a website that complies with Unicity + legal rules.

3. **CTAs you *can* use:**
   - “If you want to see exactly what I use, the link’s in my bio.”
   - “I put my full daily routine and what I use on a page – check the link.”

4. **CTAs you should avoid:**
   - “DM me to join my team.”
   - “Make $X a month from home with me.”
   - “This cures X” / “This will fix your [diagnosed condition].”

## 7. How this should shape your AI Social Media Co-Pilot

To align your **React + FastAPI + Google Gemini** app with TikTok best practices and this compliance context:

### 7.1 Encode these rules into the AI system prompt

- The agent must:
  - Optimize for **watch time, hook, and clarity** (not clickbait).
  - Use **TikTok SEO** patterns (keywords in caption, on-screen text, and script).
  - Prefer **educational + routine content** over salesy or recruitment tone.
  - Always:
    - Avoid disease names and cure language.
    - Avoid income or “business opportunity” language.
  - Use **soft CTAs** that point to “learn more in bio”.

### 7.2 Use templates based on this playbook

Have the agent choose from templates like:

1. **30s Educational Tip**
   - Hook (“If you struggle with ___, watch this”)
   - 3 bullet-style tips
   - Soft CTA

2. **Routine Breakdown**
   - Hook (“My 3-step evening routine for more stable mornings”)
   - Morning/evening steps
   - Product appears as part of routine

3. **Story Snapshot**
   - Short before/after *feeling* story (not medical), then tips.

### 7.3 Let the agent “think in series”

- Generate not just one video, but:
  - A 5-part series plan with titles, hooks, and TikTok SEO keywords.
- That matches how growth actually works now (series + consistency).

## 8. Quick checklist you can give your dad

**When recording any TikTok:**

- [ ] One clear topic per video  
- [ ] Hook in 1–3 seconds  
- [ ] 15–45s total length  
- [ ] On-screen text includes the main “how to / what” phrase  
- [ ] Speak the keyword once near the start  
- [ ] Simple, natural caption with that phrase  
- [ ] 3–5 hashtags (1–2 specific, 1–2 broad)  
- [ ] No disease names, no cure talk, no income talk  
- [ ] Soft CTA only (“link in bio if you’re curious”)  

If your AI agent writes scripts and captions that follow these rules most of the time, you’re aligned with how TikTok actually works in 2025—and you greatly reduce the risk of getting flagged for MLM or medical-claim violations.
