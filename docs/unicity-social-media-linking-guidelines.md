# Unicity Social Media Linking Guidelines

Based on research of Unicity's official compliance guidelines and best practices.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Distributor Identification
- **Profile/Bio**: Must clearly identify as "Independent Unicity Distributor"
- **Posts**: Not required in every post caption, but should be transparent in profile
- **Transparency**: Builds credibility and trust with audience

### 2. Link Placement Strategy

**DO:**
- Use "link in bio" format in captions
- Place actual referral links in profile/bio section
- Use soft CTAs: "If you're curious what I use, the link's in my bio."
- Alternative: "Want to learn more? Check the link in my bio."

**DON'T:**
- Include actual URLs in post captions (TikTok/Instagram best practice)
- Use hard-selling language
- Say "DM me to join my team" (MLM recruitment language is banned)
- Promise income or make medical claims

### 3. Hashtag Requirements

**Mandatory Brand Hashtags** (must appear in EVERY post):
- `#metabolichealth`
- `#healthyliving`
- `#unicity`

**Additional Hashtags** (1-2 specific + 1-2 broad):
- Specific: `#bloodsugartips`, `#energyhacks`, `#wellnessroutine`
- Broad: `#wellness`, `#healthylifestyle`, `#selfcare`

**Total**: 4-7 hashtags per post (3 mandatory + 1-4 additional)

### 4. CTA Format

**Preferred Format:**
```
[Caption body]

If you're curious what I use, the link's in my bio.

#metabolichealth #healthyliving #unicity #wellness #energy

[Health disclaimer]
```

**Alternative CTAs:**
- "Want to learn more? Check the link in my bio."
- "I put more details about this in my bio - check it out if you're interested."
- "If you want to see exactly what I use, the link's in my bio."

### 5. Compliance Requirements

**Always Include:**
- Health disclaimer at end of caption
- Core Unicity brand hashtags
- Soft, educational tone
- "Link in bio" CTA (not direct URLs)

**Never Include:**
- Direct URLs in captions
- Medical claims ("cures", "treats", "fixes")
- Income promises
- Recruitment language
- Disease names in claims context
