# TikTok Growth & Selling Playbook (2025–2026)  
_For educational / wellness products in an MLM-adjacent context_

---

## 0. First: Reality check for this specific context

Because your dad’s product is **borderline MLM + health-related**, there are two big constraints you *cannot ignore*:

1. **TikTok bans MLM promotion.**  
   TikTok updated its community guidelines to **explicitly ban content that promotes multi-level marketing, pyramid and Ponzi schemes**.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
   - That means: no “join my team”, no recruitment funnels, no “DM me to learn how to make $$$”.

2. **TikTok restricts medical/health claims.**  
   - TikTok Shop prohibits the sale of medicines, some medical devices and medicinal supplements.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
   - Its policies also **restrict medical claims** that suggest a product can cure serious conditions that require medical supervision.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
   - The FTC has separate guidance on MLMs: health and weight-loss claims must be backed by reliable evidence, and income claims must be truthful and typical.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

**So the safe positioning:**

- Focus on **education, lifestyle, and “supporting wellness”**, not cures or business opportunity.
- Let TikTok be about:
  - Stories, routines, tips, habits.
  - Soft call-to-action → “learn more” (link in bio), NOT “join my downline”.

Everything below assumes you stay inside that lane.

## 1. How the TikTok algorithm works in 2025–2026 (what it rewards)

Recent analyses of the 2025 algorithm agree on the basics: TikTok is a **personalized recommendation engine** that test-drives every video in stages.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

**Key signals:**

- **Watch time / completion rate** – most important. Videos that are watched to the end (or replayed) are far more likely to be pushed.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Early engagement** – likes, comments, shares, saves in the first “test batch” viewers.
- **User interactions over time** – what they normally watch, like, comment on, follow, etc.:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Video info** – caption text, on-screen text, sounds, hashtags, topic signals.:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

**Practical implications:**

- Short, **high-retention** videos beat long, boring ones.
- You must **hook in the first 1–3 seconds** or they’ll scroll.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Topic clarity (caption + on-screen text + spoken keyword) helps TikTok know *who* to show it to.

## 2. TikTok SEO in 2025–2026 (search is huge now)

TikTok has effectively become a **search engine**, and “TikTok SEO” now matters as much as the FYP.:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

### 2.1 How people search

- Users search “**how to…**”, “best…”, “does X help with…”, “daily routine for…”.
- TikTok ranks based on:
  - Relevance (keywords in caption, on-screen text, audio)
  - Engagement + watch time
  - Account and niche consistency

### 2.2 Where to put your keywords

Best practices from multiple TikTok SEO guides:​:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

Use your main keyword in:

- **On-screen text in first 3 seconds**  
  E.g. `Text overlay: "3 tips to reduce afternoon energy crashes"`.
- **Spoken audio**  
  Say the main phrase once near the start.
- **Caption**  
  Short, natural language + key phrase:  
  `Feeling that 3pm crash? Here are 3 habits that helped me stabilize my energy (no crazy hacks).`
- **Hashtags**  
  Mix of:
  - 1–2 *specific* (#metabolichealth, #bloodsugartips)
  - 1–2 *broad* (#wellness, #healthyliving)
- **Thumbnail text** (if you use custom covers).

**For your dad’s niche**, keyword themes could be:

- “how to feel more stable energy”
- “evening routine for better sleep”
- “how to build healthier snack habits”
- “what I eat for more stable energy”

Stick to **behavior / lifestyle**, not disease names and medical claims.

## 3. Content strategy: how to grow *and* sell without triggering bans

Given the MLM ban and health-claim restrictions, you want **value-first content pillars**:

### 3.1 Suggested content pillars

1. **Education (“why”)**  
   - Short explanations about energy, cravings, routines, habits.
   - Simple metaphors / visuals, no clinical promises.

2. **Routines & habits (“how”)**  
   - Morning / evening routines.
   - “What I do before bed to set up tomorrow’s energy”.
   - Small habit stacks your dad actually uses.

3. **Story-based (“me too” connection)**  
   - Brief “before/after” *feelings*, not radical transformations.
   - “I used to crash hard at 3pm; here are three changes that helped me.”

4. **Social proof / community (careful)**  
   - General encouragement: “you’re not alone, many people struggle with…”.
   - Avoid screenshotting DMs or testimonials with medical or income claims.

5. **Soft product integration**  
   - Product shows up *inside* the routine:
     - A drink during morning walk.
     - A supplement *as part of* a meal.
   - CTA: “If you’re curious what I’m using, link is in my bio.”

### 3.2 Content mix

A realistic mix for 2025–2026:

- ~60–70% **pure value** (education, routines, stories)  
- ~20–30% **value + soft product mention**  
- <10% **direct CTA** (still compliant and not MLM-y)

This keeps the account from feeling like an infomercial and aligns with how the algorithm rewards **useful, watchable content**.:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## 4. Creative best practices for short-form video (what works in 2025)

Short-form is still “king” across platforms in 2025 because it’s easier to consume and produce while matching attention spans.:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

### 4.1 Length

- Sweet spot: **15–45 seconds** for most videos.
- Experiment with occasional **45–60 seconds** when you’re telling a deeper story.
- Completion rate beats raw length.

### 4.2 Structure for each video

Use a simple repeatable structure:

1. **Hook (0–3s)**  
   - “If you crash every day at 3pm, watch this.”
   - “Here are 3 things I changed about my mornings after 40.”

2. **Context / empathy (3–8s)**  
   - “I used to feel wiped by mid-afternoon…”

3. **Value steps (8–30s)**  
   - Tip 1, 2, 3.
   - Show B-roll of daily life.

4. **Soft CTA (last 3–5s)**  
   - “If this was helpful, save this for later.”  
   - “If you’re curious what I use in my routine, the link’s in my bio.”

### 4.3 Visual & audio basics

From TikTok’s own creative best-practice guides and general short-form research:​:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  

- **Vertical 9:16** always.
- **Good lighting** (window light is fine).
- **Clean audio** or use voiceover + trending sound underlay at low volume.
- Add **captions** (burned-in or auto-captions). Many users watch with sound low/off.
- Use text overlays to:
  - Reinforce hook
  - Highlight step numbers
  - Add key phrases (for SEO)

### 4.4 Trend usage in 2025

- Trend sounds and formats **still help**, but:
  - They’re not enough to build a lasting audience.:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
  - Prioritize **original content + strong hooks** over chasing every trend.

## 5. Posting cadence & engagement strategy

### 5.1 Frequency

- For growth: **3–7 posts per week** is realistic.
- Think in **series**, not one-offs:
  - “Energy Tip Tuesday”
  - “Evening Reset Routines”
  - “My 40+ Wellness Check-in”

Series create anticipation and help the algorithm understand your niche.

### 5.2 Timing & early engagement

Some analyses suggest posting at **“off-peak” hours** can sometimes help because there’s less competition when your first test batch sees the video.:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

More important than time is **what happens in the first hour**:

- Reply to comments quickly.
- Pin a helpful comment (FAQ, disclaimer, link reminder).
- Encourage saves (“save this to try later”) and shares (“send to someone who needs this”).

### 5.3 Analytics feedback loop

Use TikTok analytics to track:

- **Average watch time** vs. video length.
- **Retention curve** (where do people drop off?).
- **What topics or hooks outperform** others.

Then refine:

- Double down on topics with higher completion rates.
- Kill formats that consistently underperform.

## 6. Selling responsibly: turning views into action without triggering enforcement

Given TikTok’s rules and FTC expectations, the safest funnel looks like:

1. **TikTok = front-end education + light invitation**
   - No income promises.
   - No big medical promises.
   - No recruitment language.

2. **Profile link = deeper explanation / sales page**
   - Move serious detail (pricing, legal disclaimers, more claims, etc.) off-platform to a website that complies with Unicity + legal rules.

3. **CTAs you *can* use:**
   - “If you want to see exactly what I use, the link’s in my bio.”
   - “I put my full daily routine and what I use on a page – check the link.”

4. **CTAs you should avoid:**
   - “DM me to join my team.”
   - “Make $X a month from home with me.”
   - “This cures X” / “This will fix your [diagnosed condition].”

Match this with the platform’s MLM ban and restricted medical claims.:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

## 7. How this should shape your AI Social Media Co-Pilot

To align your **React + FastAPI + Google Gemini** app with 2025/26 TikTok best practices and this compliance context:

### 7.1 Encode these rules into the AI system prompt

- The agent must:
  - Optimize for **watch time, hook, and clarity** (not clickbait).
  - Use **TikTok SEO** patterns (keywords in caption, on-screen text, and script).
  - Prefer **educational + routine content** over salesy or recruitment tone.
  - Always:
    - Avoid disease names and cure language.
    - Avoid income or “business opportunity” language.
  - Use **soft CTAs** that point to “learn more in bio”.

### 7.2 Use templates based on this playbook

Have the agent choose from templates like:

1. **30s Educational Tip**
   - Hook (“If you struggle with ___, watch this”)
   - 3 bullet-style tips
   - Soft CTA

2. **Routine Breakdown**
   - Hook (“My 3-step evening routine for more stable mornings”)
   - Morning/evening steps
   - Product appears as part of routine

3. **Story Snapshot**
   - Short before/after *feeling* story (not medical), then tips.

### 7.3 Let the agent “think in series”

- Generate not just one video, but:
  - A 5-part series plan with titles, hooks, and TikTok SEO keywords.
- That matches how growth actually works now (series + consistency).

## 8. Quick checklist you can give your dad

**When recording any TikTok:**

- [ ] One clear topic per video  
- [ ] Hook in 1–3 seconds  
- [ ] 15–45s total length  
- [ ] On-screen text includes the main “how to / what” phrase  
- [ ] Speak the keyword once near the start  
- [ ] Simple, natural caption with that phrase  
- [ ] 3–5 hashtags (1–2 specific, 1–2 broad)  
- [ ] No disease names, no cure talk, no income talk  
- [ ] Soft CTA only (“link in bio if you’re curious”)  

If your AI agent writes scripts and captions that follow these rules 95% of the time, you’re aligned with how TikTok actually works in 2025–and you greatly reduce the risk of getting flagged for MLM or medical-claim violations.
